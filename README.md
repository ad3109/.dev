# WELCOME to 3109!

[3109.dev](https://3109.dev) is one of the largest [Web3](https://www.3109.dev/glossary/web3/) hubs on the Internet. It is a Web3 info repository for all things tech related -

* [Coding](https://www.3109.dev/web3-coding/)
* [Privacy](https://www.3109.dev/web3-privacy-security/)
* [UX/UI](https://www.3109.dev/ux-ui/)
and [more!](https://www.3109.dev/web3-tools/) 

3109's goal is to sharpen the skills of existing Web3 techs and to inform devs/engineers in the Web2 world that are not familiar with Web3.
